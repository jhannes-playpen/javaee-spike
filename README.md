The Java EE Spike - Tests for web a webapp and nothing more
===========================================================

This project contains examples of how to write tests at various
levels for a three tier Java Web Application, using servlets
and JDBC for request processing and persistence, respectively.

The same sorts of tests can be used with most web frameworks,
if you find the right interception points.

The project only have test and provided dependencies
(no compile dependencies) and runs on Java 6 on any
servlet container which implements the servlet 2.5 spec.
